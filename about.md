Hi there! My name is Bayu Aldi Yansyah and I'm studying Mathematics at 
[Airlangga University](http://unair.ac.id).

I'm obsessed distributed systems and Machine Learning. I believe that the best approach is to focus on the end goal and workflow, rather than the underlying technologies. I will use the best technology available to solve the problem.

See what's currently I'm [hacking on](https://github.com/pyk) or [talking about](https://twitter.com/peeyek).
