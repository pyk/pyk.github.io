I passed the [Salestock][ss] backend technical assesment.

This [commit][c] will exactly tell you how I felt at that time.

For me, they are not responsive. I got reply after 2 days. It make me feel like 

"OK, YOU GUYS ARE CALL ME AND TOLD ME TODO THIS. I WILL NOT working on this if you are not responding my questions"

But, I'm afraid at the same time. I'm afraid that I became a person who can hold their words. Because, I say to the recruiters who call me that I'm going to do their assesment.

So, I decided to working on it and here it is the [result][res]. After I submit my work, the recruiter call me that I passed their backend technical assesment a few hours later.

The recruiters only say that my submission is good. Wondering if they are ever really read my code.
