Getting work, school and life balance is very hard to do but it is possible. 

For me, the balance is about optimizing my time and energy to be used for the right thing. To be able to do that, I need to know what task that need to be done for tomorrow.

In practice, time and energy is a limited resources. Doing the whole thing at once is a bad idea. So splitting task to smaller sub-task is allow me to have a sense of accomplishment. Also, allocating time for break is allow me to keep my energy stable.

I don't have work, school and life balance yet. But, I feel on the right track to accomplish that.
